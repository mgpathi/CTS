 
   Angular-  scope
   ================
   
   --> is an object that refers to the application model
   --> is an execution context for expressions
   --> Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure
       ( which mimic the DOM structure of the application)
   --> Scopes can  watch expressions and propagate events.	   
  
   
   Scope characteristics
   ---------------------
      
   --> Nested scopes are either 
       "child scopes" or "isolated scopes"
   --> A "child scope" (prototypically) 
       inherits properties from its parent scope
   --> An "isolate scope" does not
   
   
   Scope as Data-Model
   ----------------------
   
   -> Scope is the glue between application controller
      and the view.
	  
	Scope Hierarchies
	-----------------
	
	Each Angular application has exactly one root scope,
	but may have several child scopes.
